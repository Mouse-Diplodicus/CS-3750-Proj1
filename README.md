# CS-3750 - Project 1

## Description

Write THREE independent programs in three SEPARATE directories: a key generation program, a sender’s program, and a
receiver’s program, to implement symmetric-key encrypted message and its digital signature.

In the key generation program in the directory “KeyGen”;
1. Create a pair of RSA public and private keys for X, Kx+ and Kx–;
2. Create a pair of RSA public and private keys for Y, Ky+ and Ky–;
3. Get the modulus and exponent of each RSA public or private key and save them into files named “XPublic.key”, 
   “XPrivate.key”, “YPublic.key”, and “YPrivate.key”, respectively;
4. Take  a  16-character  user  input  from  the  keyboard  and  save  this  16-character  string  to  a  file  named  “symmetric.key”.    This
   string’s 128-bit UTF-8 encoding will be used as the 128-bit AES symmetric key, Kxy, in your application.

In the sender’s program in the directory “Sender”, calculate AES-En Kxy (RSA-En Kx– (SHA256 (M)) || M) bytes long 
(In this option, X is the sender and Y is the receiver).
1. To test this program, the corresponding key files need to be copied here from the directory “KeyGen”
2. Read the information on the keys to be used in this program from the key files and generate Kx – and Kxy.
3. Display a prompt “Input the name of the message file:” and take a user input from the keyboard. This 
   user input provides the name of the file containing the message M. M can NOT be assumed to be a text message. The
   size of the message M could be much larger than 32KB.
4. Read the message, M, from the file specified in Step 3 piece by piece, where each piece is recommended to be a small
   multiple of 1024 bytes, calculate the SHA256 hash value (digital digest) of the entire message M, i.e., SHA256(M), SAVE
   it into a file named “message.dd”, and DISPLAY SHA256(M) in Hexadecimal bytes.
   
   1. An added feature for testing whether the receiver’s program can handle the case properly when the digital digest
      calculated in Step 6 (the receiver’s program) is different from the digital digest obtained in Step 5 (the receiver’s
      program): After calculating SHA256(M) but before saving it to the file named “message.dd” (the sender’s program),
      display a prompt “Do you want to invert the 1st byte in SHA256(M)? (Y or N)”,
      1. If the user input is ‘Y’, modify the first byte in your byte array holding SHA256(M) by replacing it with its bitwise
         inverted value (hint: the ~ operator in Java does it), complete the rest of Step 4 by SAVING & DISPLAYING the
         modified SHA256(M), instead of the original SHA256(M), and continue to Step 5 (also use the modified
         SHA256(M), instead of the original SHA256(M), in Steps 5 & 6).
      2. Otherwise, (if the user input is ‘N’), make NO change to the byte array holding SHA256(M), complete the rest of
         Step 4 (SAVE and DISPLAY), and continue to Step 5.
           
5. Calculate the RSA Encryption of SHA256(M) using Kx – (Question: how many bytes is the cyphertext?), SAVE this RSA
   cyphertext (the digital signature of M), into a file named “message.ds-msg”, and DISPLAY it in Hexadecimal bytes.
   APPEND the message M read from the file specified in Step 3 to the file “message.ds-msg” piece by piece.    
6. Calculate the AES Encryption of (RSA-En Kx– (SHA256 (M)) || M) using Kxy by reading the file “message.ds-msg” piece
   by piece, where each piece is recommended to be a multiple of 16 bytes long. (Hint: if the length of the last piece is less
   than that multiple of 16 bytes, it needs to be placed in a byte array whose array size is the length of the last piece before
   being encrypted.) SAVE the resulting blocks of AES ciphertext into a file named “message.aescipher”.

In  the  receiver’s  program  in  the  directory  “Receiver”,  using  AES  and  RSA Decryptions to  get  SHA256 (M)  and  M,
compare SHA256(M) with the locally calculated SHA256 hash of M, report hashing error if any, and then save M to a file.
1. To  test  this  program,  the  corresponding  key  files  need  to  be  copied  here  from  the  directory  “KeyGen”,
   and  the  file “message.aescipher” needs to be copied here from the directory “Sender”.
2. Read the information on the keys to be used in this program from the key files and generate Kx+ and Kxy.
3. Display a prompt “Input the name of the message file:” and take a user input from the keyboard.  The 
   resulting message M will be saved to this file at the end of this program.
4. Read the ciphertext, C, from the file “message.aescipher” block by block, where each block needs to be a multiple of 16 
   bytes long.  (Hint: if the length of the last block is less than that multiple of 16 bytes, it needs to be placed in a byte array 
   whose array size is the length of the last piece before being decrypted.)  Calculate the AES Decryption of C using Kxy 
   block by block to get RSA-En Kx- (SHA256 (M)) || M, and save the resulting pieces into a file named “message.ds-msg”.
5. If using "RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding", read the first 128 bytes from the file “message.ds-msg” to get the digital signature RSA-En Kx-
   (SHA256 (M)), and copy the message M, i.e., the leftover bytes in the file “message.ds-msg”, to a file whose
   name  is  specified  in  Step  3. (Why  128  bytes?  Why  is  the  leftover  M?)  Calculate  the  RSA  Decryption  of  this  digital
   signature using Kx+ to get the digital digest SHA256(M), SAVE this digital digest into a file named “message.dd”, and
   DISPLAY it in Hexadecimal bytes.
6. Read the message M from the file whose name is specified in Step 3 piece by piece, where each piece is recommended to
   be a small multiple of 1024 bytes, calculate the SHA256 hash value (digital digest) of the entire message M, DISPLAY it
   in Hexadecimal bytes, compare it with the digital digest obtained in Step 5, display whether the digital digest passes the
   authentication check. 

Except for the file named “symmetric.key” (a TEXT file), ALL other files MUST be treated as binary files in I/O operations and handled
by either ObjectInputStream & ObjectOutputStream (for public/private key files) or BufferedInputStream & BufferedOutputStream
(for various message files).

## Running the Program

To start the programs use the following commands:

> java KeyGen  
> java Receiver

Once started the program will ...

## Compiling the Program

If the program needs to be compiled use the following commands:

> javac KeyGen.java 
> javac Receiver.java
